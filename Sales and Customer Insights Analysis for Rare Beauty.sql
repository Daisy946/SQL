**How can we analyze the sales trends by product to find out which products have the highest total sales amount and total quantity sold?

SELECT Product_ID, SUM(Quantity_Sold) AS Total_Quantity_Sold, SUM(Total_Sales) AS Total_Sales_Amount
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product_ID
ORDER BY Total_Sales_Amount DESC;



**What SQL query can we use to calculate the average customer rating and total number of reviews for each product based on customer feedback?
  
SELECT Product_ID, AVG(Rating) AS Average_Rating, COUNT(Feedback_ID) AS Total_Reviews
FROM Customer_Feedback
GROUP BY Product_ID;
